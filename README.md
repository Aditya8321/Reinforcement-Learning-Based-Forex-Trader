# Reinforcement Learning Based Forex Trader

This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for building a Reinforcement Learning–based trading system.  
It includes data collection, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and a Streamlit app for visualization.

## 🔄 Workflow Stages

1. **Data Acquisition (`data_acquisition.ipynb`)**  
   - Collects raw forex data from APIs or stored datasets.  
   - Ensures data integrity and saves it into the `data/` folder.  

2. **Data Preprocessing (`data_preprocessing.ipynb`)**  
   - Cleans missing values, handles outliers, and normalizes inputs.  
   - Prepares datasets for downstream modeling.  

3. **Data Storage (`data_storage.ipynb`)**  
   - Stores processed datasets in structured formats.  
   - Ensures reproducibility for experiments.  

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (`exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`)**  
   - Generates summary statistics and visualizations.  
   - Identifies important patterns, trends, and anomalies.  

5. **Feature Engineering (`feature_engineering.ipynb`)**  
   - Creates new features (technical indicators, rolling averages, etc.).  
   - Improves model performance by adding domain-specific signals.  

6. **Model Training (`model_training.ipynb`)**  
   - Trains Reinforcement Learning agents on processed datasets.  
   - Evaluates models with backtesting and performance metrics.  

7. **Streamlit App (`streamlit_rep.py`)**  
   - Interactive dashboard for model outputs.  
   - Visualizes performance metrics, trading signals, and strategies.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
cd REPO_NAME
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage

Run notebooks step by step:

jupyter notebook


Or launch the Streamlit app:

streamlit run streamlit_rep.py

📝 Notes

Large datasets (.csv, .zip) are excluded via .gitignore.

To reproduce experiments, ensure that data/ contains the necessary files.

📌 Future Work

Add hyperparameter tuning scripts.

Automate the full pipeline with a single execution script.

Integrate live trading APIs.
